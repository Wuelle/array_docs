How are matrices stored in memory? As mentioned before, matrices are multidimensional. Since computer memory is one-dimensional, we need to flatten the matrix. This is where strides come into play. A stride is the number of bytes between elements in memory. This is usually equal to the element size. (Unless the matrix is padded) This means that for a matrix \\(A\\) of size \\(m\\times{n}\\) with a stride of 1, the elements \\(A_{i, j}\\) and \\(A_{i+1, j}\\) are 1 byte apart and the elements \\(A_{i, j}\\) and \\(A_{i, j+1}\\) are m bytes apart.","title":"What is a matrix"},{"location":"chapter1/#what-is-a-matrix","text":"A matrix is a multidimensional collection of objects.","title":"What is a matrix"},{"location":"chapter1/#how-are-matrices-stored-in-memory","text":"As mentioned before, matrices are multidimensional.
