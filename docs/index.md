# Welcome

This is a documentation of my journey to implementing a (hopefully) fast
matrix library. It is less of a blog and more of a diary (meaning its primarily intended
for myself to look up stuff in the future)
I intend to use it for my [deep learning library](https://www.github.com/Wuelle/deep_thought).
